# OAuth 2.0

## (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization. It allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password.

Here's a simplified flow:

- The client (could be a web app) requests authorization from the user.
- The user authorizes the client and gets an **authorization grant**.
- The client presents the **authorization grant** to the authorization server and gets an **access token** (JWT).
- The client can now access the resource server (API) using the **access token**.

OAuth 2.0 is commonly used in scenarios where you see "**Login with Google**" or "**Login with Facebook**".
The advantage is that the user doesn't have to share their password with the third-party app, and they can control what information the third-party app can access.
