# Popular collections and algorithms in Scala

## Array: An Array is a mutable, indexed collection of objects. All elements are stored contiguously in memory

- Access: O(1)
- Update: O(1)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion: O(n)
- Deletion: O(n)

### API

- scala.Array
- scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer

## List: A List in Scala is an immutable linear sequence of elements

- Access: O(n)
- Update: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Search in on a sorted list: O(log n)
- Prepend (cons operation, ::): O(1)
- Append: O(n)
- Sort list: O(n log n)
  - Sort algorithms:
    - Merge sort: O(n log n) - divide and conquer
    - Quick sort: O(n log n) - divide and conquer
    - Bubble sort: O(n^2)
    - Insertion sort: O(n^2)

### API

- scala.collection.immutable.List
- scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer


## Vector: A Vector is an immutable, indexed sequence. It provides fast random access and updates, as well as fast append and prepend operations.

- Access: O(log n)
- Update: O(log n)
- Search: O(n)
- Append/Prepend: O(1)

## Set and Map

### Set: A Set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Scala provides both mutable and immutable versions.

- Access: N/A (Sets do not provide access by index)
- Update: N/A (For immutable sets)
- Search (contains): O(1) for HashSet, O(log n) for TreeSet
- Insertion: O(1) for HashSet, O(log n) for TreeSet
- Deletion: O(1) for HashSet, O(log n) for TreeSet

### HashMap and HashSet: These are implementations of the mutable Map and Set interfaces, respectively, which provide constant-time performance for most operations.

- Access: O(1)
- Update: O(1)
- Search: O(1)
- Insertion: O(1)
- Deletion: O(1)
- Note: The actual performance may degrade in the presence of hash collisions.

### TreeMap and TreeSet: These are implementations of SortedMap and SortedSet, respectively, which maintain elements in sorted order

### Complexity

- Access: O(log n)
- Update: O(log n)
- Search: O(log n)
- Insertion: O(log n)
- Deletion: O(log n)

### API

- scala.collection.Set,
- scala.collection.Map,
- scala.collection.(im)mutable.HashMap
- scala.collection.(im)mutable.TreeMap

## Queue (Deque) - FIFO (scala.collection.(immutable|mutable).Queue)


### Complexity

- Adding an element (enqueue): O(1)
- Removing an element (dequeue): O(1)
- Accessing the front element (front): O(1)
- Searching for an element: O(n)

### API

- scala.collection.mutable.Queue
- scala.collection.(im)mutable.Queue
- Deque: scala.collection.mutable.ArrayDeque
- Deque: scala.collection.mutable.ListDeque

## Stack - LIFO

### Complexity

- Adding an element (push): O(1)
- Removing an element (pop): O(1)
- Accessing the top element (peek): O(1)
- Searching for an element: O(n)

### API

- scala.collection.mutable.Stack

## Tree: Is a data structure that is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It is a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes

Tree types:
- Binary tree
- Red-black tree
- Trie

Binary tree search algorithms:
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Breadth-first search (BFS)

## Graph: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected.
