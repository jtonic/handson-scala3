# Popular collections and algorithms in Scala

## Array: An Array is a mutable, indexed collection of objects. All elements are stored contiguously in memory.

- Access: O(1)
- Update: O(1)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion: O(n)
- Deletion: O(n)

## List: A List in Scala is an immutable linear sequence of elements

- Access: O(n)
- Update: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Search in on a sorted list: O(log n)
- Prepend (cons operation, ::): O(1)
- Append: O(n)
- Sort list: O(n log n)
  - Sort algorithms:
    - Merge sort: O(n log n) - devide and conquer
    - Quick sort: O(n log n) - devide and conquer
    - Bubble sort: O(n^2)
    - Insertion sort: O(n^2)

## Vector: A Vector is an immutable, indexed sequence. It provides fast random access and updates, as well as fast append and prepend operations.

- Access: O(log n)
- Update: O(log n)
- Search: O(n)
- Append/Prepend: O(1)

## Set: A Set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Scala provides both mutable and immutable versions.

- Access: N/A (Sets do not provide access by index)
- Update: N/A (For immutable sets)
- Search (contains): O(1) for HashSet, O(log n) for TreeSet
- Insertion: O(1) for HashSet, O(log n) for TreeSet
- Deletion: O(1) for HashSet, O(log n) for TreeSet

## HashMap and HashSet: These are implementations of the mutable Map and Set interfaces, respectively, which provide constant-time performance for most operations.

- Access: O(1)
- Update: O(1)
- Search: O(1)
- Insertion: O(1)
- Deletion: O(1)
- Note: The actual performance may degrade in the presence of hash collisions.

## TreeMap and TreeSet: These are implementations of SortedMap and SortedSet, respectively, which maintain elements in sorted order

- Access: O(log n)
- Update: O(log n)
- Search: O(log n)
- Insertion: O(log n)
- Deletion: O(log n)

## Tree: Is a data structure that is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It is a hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.

Tree types:
- Binary tree
- Red-black tree
- Trie

Binary tree search algorithms:
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Breadth-first search (BFS)

## Graph: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected.
