1. - [x] HashSet, HashMap
   1. - [x] Implementation
      - load factor (0.75)
      - hash collision (linked list and balanced BST for buckets)
      - rehashing (double the size of the array and rehash all the elements)
   2. - [x] TreeSet and TreeMap
      - red-black BST (implementation)
   3. - [x] O(n) for operations on them
      [performance on scala collections](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections-2.13/performance-characteristics.html)
   4. - [x] computation of hash code

   ```java
       public int hashCode() {
        int result = firstName.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + lastName.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + age;
        return result;
    }
   ```

2. - [ ] More useful shortcuts in VS Code
3. - [ ] popular collections with popular methods such as map, filter, flat map, zip, drop, keep, fold, reduce, partition
   - operands
4. - [ ] Scala Pattern matching
