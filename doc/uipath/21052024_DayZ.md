# Day Z

1. - [x] HashSet, HashMap

   1. - [x] Implementation
      - load factor (0.75)
      - hash collision (linked list and balanced BST for buckets)
      - rehashing (double the size of the array and rehash all the elements)

   2. - [x] TreeSet and TreeMap
      - red-black BST (implementation)

   3. - [x] O(n) for operations on them
      [performance on scala collections](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections-2.13/performance-characteristics.html)
   4. - [x] computation of hash code

   ```java
       public int hashCode() {
        int result = firstName.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + lastName.hashCode();
        result = 31 * result + age;
        return result;
    }
   ```

2. - [x] Methods on Stack
   - push
   - pop
   - top

3. - [x] Methods on Queue
   - queue
   - dequeue
   - peek (front)

4. - [x] popular collections with popular methods such as map, filter, flat map, zip, drop, take, fold, reduce, partition, group
   - [ ] operands

5. - [x] Scala Pattern matching

   ```scala
   val a: Int | Null = null

   a match
     case _: Int => println("Int")
     case _      => println("null")
   ```

   ```scala
   extension [A](list: List[A])
   def headOption: Option[A] = list match
     case Nil => None
     case head :: _ => Some(head)
   ```

   ```scala
   class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int):
   override def toString: String = s"Point($x, $y)"
   override def equals(that: Any): Boolean =
     that match
       case that: Point => this.x == that.x && this.y == that.y
       case _ => false
   ```

6. - [x] More useful shortcuts in VS Code

7. - [x] Popular binary algorithms

   - divide by 2 (right shift)
   - multiply by 2 (left shift)
   - isEven (last bit is 0) (bitwise AND with 1)
   - isOdd (last bit is 1) (bitwise AND with 1)
   - isPowerOf2 (only one bit is set) (bitwise AND with n-1)

8. - [x]  Indexed and Sequential Scala Collections

   1. - [x] scala.collection.IndexedSeq
      - scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer
      - scala.collection.immutable.Range
      - scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq
      - scala.collection.immutable.Vector

   2. - [x] scala.collection.LinearSeq
      scala.collection.immutable.List
